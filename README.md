# Wireframing

Wireframing is one of the earliest and most essential steps in the design process for digital products like websites and apps. It involves creating simple, low-detail layouts that show where content and functionality will appear on a screen—before any colors, images, or polished designs are added.

Think of wireframes as blueprints for your digital product. They help teams plan out structure and user flow clearly and quickly. This not only saves time and effort but also ensures that everyone—designers, developers, and stakeholders—is aligned before moving into the more detailed phases of design and development.

## Why Wireframing Matters

- **Clarifies structure and layout early**
- **Makes user flows easy to visualize**
- **Encourages team collaboration and feedback**
- **Saves time by catching usability issues before development begins**
