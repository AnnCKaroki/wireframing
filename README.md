# Wireframing

Wireframing is one of the earliest and most essential steps in the design process for digital products like websites and apps. It involves creating simple, low-detail layouts that show where content and functionality will appear on a screen—before any colors, images, or polished designs are added.

Think of wireframes as blueprints for your digital product. They help teams plan out structure and user flow clearly and quickly. This not only saves time and effort but also ensures that everyone—designers, developers, and stakeholders—is aligned before moving into the more detailed phases of design and development.

## Why Wireframing Matters

- **Clarifies structure and layout early**
- **Makes user flows easy to visualize**
- **Encourages team collaboration and feedback**
- **Saves time by catching usability issues before development begins**

## Key Elements of Wireframing

A wireframe isn't just a sketch—it follows a structure made up of important design elements that determine how users interact with a product. Here are the four key components you’ll typically find in a wireframe:

### 1. Layout Structure

This is the backbone of any interface. It defines the overall arrangement of elements on a screen using grids or blocks.

**Example**: In a property booking app, the layout might place a search bar at the top, filters on the left, and property listings in the main content area. This layout ensures users know exactly where to look for each feature.

---

### 2. Navigation

Navigation shows how users move from one part of the product to another. It includes menus, tabs, and links.

**Example**: A top navigation bar with links like “Home,” “Bookings,” and “Profile” helps users quickly understand how to explore the site or app without confusion.

---

### 3. Content Placement

This determines where images, text, buttons, and other elements appear on the screen—based on what users expect and need to see first.

**Example**: In an e-commerce wireframe, product images are often placed at the top with price and “Add to Cart” buttons right below to catch attention and encourage action.

---

### 4. Functionality

Functionality refers to how users interact with components like buttons, sliders, form inputs, or popups.

**Example**: A “Book Now” button might trigger a modal where users select dates and confirm payment. Wireframes show where this button goes and what happens when it’s clicked—even if it’s just a sketch.

---

Each of these elements works together to shape the user's experience, helping teams design products that are clear, usable, and effective.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail, depending on the stage of the design process and the purpose of the wireframe. The two main types are:

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes

These are simple, fast, and usually black-and-white sketches. They focus on layout, structure, and basic user flow—without any detailed content, branding, or visual styling.

**When to Use**:  
Low-fidelity wireframes are ideal during the early brainstorming or ideation stage. They help teams quickly map out ideas, test basic flows, and gather feedback without worrying about visuals.

**Example**: A wireframe showing boxes for images, placeholder text like "Title Here," and simple arrows to show navigation flow.

---

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes

These are more detailed and closely resemble the final product. They often include real content, spacing, visual hierarchy, and interactive elements like buttons or form fields.

**When to Use**:  
High-fidelity wireframes are useful in later stages of the design process when you're preparing handoffs to developers or getting final approval from stakeholders.

**Example**: A wireframe that includes real images, styled buttons, actual font choices, and refined spacing.

## What Type of Wireframe Is Used in This Project?

The wireframe used in this project is a **low-fidelity wireframe**. It focuses on the layout, structure, and basic interaction flow without getting into detailed design or branding. This makes it easy to test ideas early, get quick feedback, and iterate rapidly before moving to visual design.

## Popular Wireframing Tools

There are many tools available that make creating wireframes easier, faster, and more collaborative. Some are better for quick sketches, while others are perfect for building full design systems. Below are some of the most widely used wireframing tools:

- **Figma** ✅
